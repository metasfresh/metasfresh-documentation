## Ãœbersicht

metasfresh enables you to keep track of a product not only as in stocked amounts but it is also possible to map in which form the article is.

As an example a product can be represented as e.g. 10 pieces in a box where as there are 20 boxes on one pallette.

To map a product (customer unit = CU) with its packaging (Transport Unit = TU) and its aids used in loading is called **Handling Unit System**.
Therefore a CU in a TU in an LU is a **Handling Unit**.
