## Steps
1. Open "Contract" from the [menu](Menu).
1. From the [list view](ViewModes#list-view), [select](RecordSelection) the [contract](Create_subscription_contract) you want to terminate.
 >**Note:** You can terminate several contracts at once. To do so, select all contracts concerned from the list view and continue with the following steps.

1. [Start the action](StartAction#actions-menu) "Contract Change". An overlay window opens up.
 >**Note:** You can also start this action directly from the respective contract's entry.

1. Choose a **Change effective by** date.
1. Select the **Action** *Terminate*.
1. Select a **Termination Reason**.
1. Click "Start" to execute the termination and close the overlay window.
 >**Note:** The [contractual terms](Define_contractual_terms) specify the date by which a contract can be terminated. If an error occurs, the termination may most likely not be permitted upon the date chosen.

1. In the [list view](ViewModes#list-view) of the contracts you can review the **Contract Status**.
