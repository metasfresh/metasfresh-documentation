## Overview
You need to configure the outbound documents for dunning so the created dunning letters will also get listed under "Outbound Documents" in the menu where you can then continue to process them either one by one or collectively.

## Steps
[Follow these instructions](Outbound_Documents_Config) and select the **Table** *Dunning* and the **Print Format** *Mahnbrief (swat)*.
 >**Note:** Should the print format not be available, then [add a new one](Add_print_format) and use the **Table** *C_Dunning_Header_v* and the **Jasper Process** *Mahnbrief (Jasper)*.
