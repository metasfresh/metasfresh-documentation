## Overview
Any contacts you want to add to a mailing list of a [marketing campaign](Create_MKTG_campaign) must be registered as [users](Add_user) in your system and [linked to a business partner](Assign_BPartner_to_user).

If you want to add [business partners](New_Business_Partner) to the mailing list of a marketing campaign, you first have to [add a user](Add_user_to_BPartner) to their entry.

| **General Note:** |

| For contacts (users or business partners) to be added to the mailing list of the marketing campaign, an [address in the business partner entry](Add_address_tab) must be set as **Standard Invoice Address**.<br> ![](assets/Standard_Invoice_Address.png) |
