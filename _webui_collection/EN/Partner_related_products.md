## Overview
Sometimes the business partners' product names and numbers differ from your own even though they refer to the same product. For instance, in your system you hold the product *Carrots*, but the customer prefers calling it *Orange roots* and the vendor *Rabbit food*.<br>
So, in order to avoid any misunderstandings and ending up with several names and numbers for the same product in your system, you can assign **partner-related product names and numbers** without having to modify your own internal data.

## Steps
1. Open the entry of an existing [product](Menu) or [add a new one](NewProduct).
1. Go to the record tab "Business Partner" at the bottom of the page and click ![](assets/Add_New_Button.png). A new window opens up.
1. Enter the name of the **Business Partner**.
 >**Note 1:** Business partners can be customers and vendors.<br><br>
 >**Note 2:** Hit `SPACE` to see all available [business partners](New_Business_Partner).<br><br>
 >**Note 3:** Select one of the shown options with the mouse or ![](../DE/assets/Workflow_Auftrag_Bis_Rechnung_WebUI-73797.png).

1. Check the box **For Vendor** or **For Customer** according to the respective business relation the new name should be used.
1. Enter the partner-related **Product name**.
1. Enter the partner-related **Product number**.
1. Click "Done" to close the window and add the partner-related data to the list.
 >**Note:** Repeat steps 2 to 7 to add further partner-related data.

**Note:** For internal purposes you keep using your own product names and numbers. Externally, the respective partner-related product names and numbers will automatically appear on documents such as sales order confirmations, shipment notes and invoices.
