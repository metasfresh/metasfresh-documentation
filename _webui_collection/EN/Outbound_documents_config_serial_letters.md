## Overview
You need to configure the outbound documents for the serial letter feature so the created serial letters will also get listed under "Outbound Documents" in the menu where you can then continue to process them either one by one or collectively.

## Steps
[Follow these instructions](Outbound_Documents_Config) and select the **Table** *Letter* and the **Print Format** *Serial Letter*.
 >**Note:** Should the print format not be available, then [add a new one](Add_print_format) and use the **Table** *Letter* and the **Jasper Process** *Serial Letter*.
