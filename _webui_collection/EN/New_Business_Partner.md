 >**Note:** The **(Company) Name** is restricted to 60 characters.

1. Select a [**Business Partner Group**](New_Business_Partner_Group), e.g., *Machine Supplier*.
1. Select the partner’s preferred language for communication.
1. [Add one or more addresses](Add_address_tab).

### Optional Steps
1. [Add some appropriate **attributes**](Add_attributes_to_BP) which might come in handy for the [filtering function](Filtering_function).

1. [Link the business partner to a price system](Assign_prices_to_partner).
