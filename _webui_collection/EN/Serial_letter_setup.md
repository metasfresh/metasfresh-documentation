## Overview
With serial letters, it takes very little effort to provide a great number of your contacts in one go with information of interest to them while successfully promoting your own marketing campaigns.

To this end, among other things, you have to configure the outbound documents for the serial letter feature in order to review and process the serial letters under "Outbound Documents" in the menu.

As part of a marketing campaign you can create text templates that will later be printed on the serial letters. Each serial letter is addressed personally to a contact.

In order to set up the serial letter feature, take the following steps:

## Steps
1. [Configure the outbound documents for the serial letter feature](Outbound_documents_config_serial_letters).
1. [Create a new marketing platform](Create_MKTG_platform).
1. [Create a new boiler plate](Create_boiler_plate) where you draft the text for the serial letters.
1. [Create a new marketing campaign](Create_MKTG_campaign) and add the previously created boiler plate to it.
1. [Add some contacts to the marketing campaign](Add_contacts_to_MKTG_campaign).
